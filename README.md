## Why?
There are many, many lightbox themed gallery libraries out there for Angular. Some of them are fairly useable, but most lack a good configuration and adaptability. Therefore the philosophy of Darkbox Gallery (Darkbox for short) is to provide good configuration options so you do not need to write extra logic to adapt Darkbox to your needs. While doing so every configuration has useful defaults so the entry barrier for using Darkbox is as low as possible. So come to the dark side of galleries; we don't keep üç™üç™.

## What does it even look like?
If you are not sure what you can expect from Darkbox please have a look at the current version of our [live demo](https://darkbox.click/).

## How?
### Installation
Install npm package for Angular version 15+:

```
npm i @failed-successfully/ngx-darkbox-gallery
```

Since Version 3 this library is provided as a standalone component.
To use it import the `NgxDarkboxGalleryComponent` into a component of your choice. In this example it is called AppComponent (`app.component.ts`)
```ts
...
import { NgxDarkboxGalleryComponent } from '@failed-successfully/ngx-darkbox-gallery';

@Component({
    selector: 'app-root',
    templateUrl: './app.component.html',
    styleUrls: ['./app.component.scss'],
    imports: [NgxDarkboxGalleryComponent]
})
export class AppComponent {
    images: Image[] = [{
        url: 'https://picsum.photos/seed/3000/2000',
        thumbnailUrl: 'https://picsum.photos/300/200'
  }];
}
```
### Usage
The simplest way of using Darkbox is to include the component with its default configuration as shown below.

Inclusion in the desired `.html` file
```ts
<darkbox-gallery [images]="images"></darkbox-gallery>
```

For an example of a more advanced Darkbox configuration have a look at [our examples](./docs/examples/advanced-configuration-example.md).

### Advanced configuration

Please have a look at all available Darkbox configurations in our [complete configuration documentation](./docs/advanced-configuration.md).

### Available events
Almost everything that happens in Darkbox triggers an event. Therefore it is easy for you to know what happened when. It is your choice to react to the provides event (e.g. using it to provide statistics). Currently Darkbox exposes the following events:

| Name                | Type    | Description                                                                       |
|---------------------|---------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| imageClicked        | Image   | Signals that a single image was clicked. The clicked images is being emitted      |
| thumbnailLoaded     | Image   | Signals that a single thumbnail was loaded. The image containing the thumbnail is being emitted|
| allThumbnailsLoaded | boolean | Signals that all thumbnails currently displayed have bean loaded                  |
| allImagesInDom      | boolean | Signals that all images provided from the input are displayed in the DOM. This does not mean that all thumbnails/images are completely loaded|
| darkboxClosed       | boolean | Signals that the lightbox/Darkbox was closed by the user                          |
| darkboxNext         | boolean | Signals that the user clicked the next image button                               |
| darkboxPrev         | boolean | Signals that the user clicked the previous image button                           |
